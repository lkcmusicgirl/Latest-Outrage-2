  <center><c>The Water Problem</c><center>
  <br>
  <center><f> By Sinai Cruz</f><center>

  <br>
  
  
  <center><v>Our earth, which is home to 7.3 billion people, is made up of 70% water.
  Freshwater, however, only covers about 3%. Two thirds of this 3% is in frozen glaciers and unavailable for use. Water scarcity affects nearly 2.8 billion of us; not to mention the 1.1 billion who lack the necessary access to clean water sources.
  Many people are unaware of this global problem we face. According to the World Wide Life Organization, as the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere increases, droughts become more common and melting glaciers disappear affecting the freshwater supplies which are vital to downstream communities.
  Melting glaciers lead to a loss of freshwater supply which could be used by animals living near these glaciers.
  Water scarcity also affects agriculture, energy generation, ecosystems, and cities. As the population keeps increasing, water ecosystems lose biodiversity due to industrialization. 
  It is estimated that by the year 2025, two-thirds of the world's’ population may be facing water shortages. The polluted seas and oceans are retracting, leaving behind infertile soil. Food shortages, caused by soil infertility, increase infant mortality rates, famine, starvation, and decrease life expectancy for nearby populations.
  With water sources running dry, people are unable to perform basic necessities such as cooking, farming, drinking, bathing, and washing. These unsanitary situations cause diseases like cholera, typhoid fever, deadly diarrhea diseases, and many other water-borne illnesses. 
  If we don’t do something about this, who will? “Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. 
  We are the change that we seek”-  Barack Obama. Learn more at:</v>
